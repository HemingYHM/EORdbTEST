# OSHA General Duty Clause

Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, known as the "General Duty Clause," requires employers to provide their employees with a workplace that is "free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm."

## General Duty Clause Requirements
**Employer Duty** (Section 5(a)(1)):
- Furnish employment and a place of employment free from recognized hazards
- Hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm
- Applies when no specific OSHA standard exists

**Employee Duty** (Section 5(b)):
- Comply with occupational safety and health standards
- Follow all rules, regulations, and orders issued under the Act

## Elements for General Duty Citation
OSHA must prove four elements:
1. **Employer exposure**: Employees were exposed to a hazard
2. **Recognized hazard**: The hazard was recognized by the employer or industry
3. **Likely to cause harm**: The hazard was causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm
4. **Feasible abatement**: There was a feasible method to correct the hazard

## Common General Duty Applications
- **Workplace violence** prevention
- **Ergonomic hazards** not covered by specific standards
- **Heat-related illnesses** in high-temperature environments
- **Infectious disease** exposure (e.g., COVID-19)
- **Combustible dust** hazards
- **Chemical exposure** beyond specific standards

## Relationship to Specific Standards
- General Duty Clause applies when **no specific standard** exists
- Cannot cite General Duty if specific OSHA standard covers the hazard
- May be used for hazards **greater than** those addressed by specific standards

## Employer Defenses
- **Employee misconduct**: Unforeseeable employee actions
- **Infeasibility**: No feasible method of abatement exists
- **Greater hazard**: Abatement would create greater hazard
- **Industry practice**: Hazard not recognized in the industry

## Employer Checklist
- Conduct regular workplace safety assessments
- Identify and evaluate potential hazards not covered by specific standards
- Implement feasible hazard control measures
- Train employees on workplace safety procedures
- Document safety efforts and hazard abatement
- Stay informed of industry safety practices
- Establish incident reporting procedures

## Penalties
- **Serious violation**: Up to $15,625 per violation
- **Willful/repeated**: Up to $156,259 per violation
- **Criminal penalties**: Possible for willful violations causing death
