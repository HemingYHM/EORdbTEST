# ACA Employer Mandate

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) requires applicable large employers (ALEs) to offer minimum essential coverage that is affordable and provides minimum value to full-time employees and their dependents, or pay penalties.

## Applicable Large Employer (ALE) Definition
**50+ full-time equivalent employees**:
- **Full-time employee**: 30+ hours per week average
- **Full-time equivalent (FTE)**: Total part-time hours ÷ 120
- **Calculation period**: Prior calendar year
- **Monthly measurement**: Must average 50+ FTE over 12 months

**Controlled group rules**:
- Related entities counted together
- Common ownership aggregation
- Brother-sister controlled groups

## Full-Time Employee Determination
**30+ hours per week** or **130+ hours per month**

**Measurement methods**:
- **Monthly measurement**: Look-back at prior month
- **Look-back measurement**: 3-12 month measurement period
- **Safe harbor periods**: Administrative periods for transitions

**Variable hour employees**:
- Use look-back measurement method
- Initial measurement period (up to 12 months)
- Standard measurement period for ongoing employees

## Coverage Requirements
**Minimum essential coverage**:
- Major medical coverage
- Must cover essential health benefits
- Cannot include limited benefit plans only

**Affordability test** (2024):
- Premium ≤ 9.02% of household income
- Safe harbors available (W-2, rate of pay, federal poverty line)

**Minimum value**:
- Plan pays ≥ 60% of covered expenses
- Must cover physician and hospital services

## Dependent Coverage
**Required coverage**:
- Employee's children up to age 26
- No requirement to cover spouses
- Coverage must be affordable for dependents

**Affordability for dependents**:
- Based on employee-only premium cost
- Cannot exceed affordability threshold

## Penalties (Employer Shared Responsibility)
**Penalty A (4980H(a))** - No coverage offered:
- **$2,880 per year** per full-time employee (2024)
- **Minus first 30 employees** (safe harbor)
- Applied if any full-time employee receives marketplace subsidy

**Penalty B (4980H(b))** - Inadequate coverage:
- **$4,320 per year** per affected employee (2024)
- Only for employees receiving marketplace subsidies
- Generally lower total penalty than Penalty A

## Reporting Requirements
**Forms 1094-C and 1095-C**:
- **Annual filing** with IRS by March 31 (April 30 if filing electronically)
- **Employee statements** by January 31
- **Information reported**: Coverage offered, affordability, months employed

**1094-C (Transmittal)**:
- Summary of employer's coverage offerings
- Aggregate employee data
- One form per controlled group

**1095-C (Employee Statement)**:
- Individual employee coverage information
- Monthly coverage and employment data
- Copy provided to each employee

## Safe Harbors
**Affordability safe harbors**:
- **W-2 safe harbor**: 9.02% of Box 1 wages
- **Rate of pay safe harbor**: 9.02% of monthly rate × 130 hours
- **Federal poverty line safe harbor**: 9.02% of FPL for single individual

**Coverage safe harbors**:
- **95% rule**: Coverage offered to 95% of full-time employees
- **Monthly measurement**: No penalty if coverage gap ≤ 3 months

## Transition Relief and Special Rules
**Seasonal worker exception**:
- 120+ days seasonal workers excluded from ALE determination
- Must be customary seasonal period

**New employer relief**:
- First year transition rules
- Limited penalties for initial compliance year

## Multi-Employer Plans
**Special rules** for:
- Union-sponsored plans
- Collectively bargained coverage
- Plan-based reporting alternatives

## EOR-Specific Considerations
**ALE determination**:
- Each legal entity measured separately
- Client companies and EOR measured independently
- Controlled group rules may apply

**Coverage responsibility**:
- EOR as employer responsible for mandate compliance
- Must offer coverage to EOR employees
- Client company not responsible for EOR's employees

## State-Based Marketplaces
**Interaction with ACA**:
- Employee eligibility for marketplace subsidies
- Employer penalty triggers
- Notification requirements for employees

## Compliance Strategy
**For EOR providers**:
- Monitor ALE status monthly
- Implement compliant health plans
- Establish measurement and administrative periods
- Maintain accurate records for reporting
- Train staff on ACA requirements

## Common Compliance Issues
**Measurement errors**:
- Incorrect FTE calculations
- Failure to apply controlled group rules
- Improper variable hour employee treatment

**Coverage deficiencies**:
- Unaffordable coverage offerings
- Inadequate minimum value plans
- Missing dependent coverage

**Reporting failures**:
- Late or missing Forms 1094-C/1095-C
- Incorrect employee information
- Failure to provide employee statements

## Penalties and Enforcement
**IRS enforcement**:
- Letter 226J penalty assessments
- Audit and examination procedures
- Appeals process available

**Penalty mitigation**:
- Good faith compliance efforts
- Reasonable cause exceptions
- Voluntary correction programs

## Technology and Compliance
**HRIS systems**: Must track ACA-relevant data
**Payroll integration**: Coordinate with benefits administration
**Reporting software**: Automate Forms 1094-C/1095-C preparation
