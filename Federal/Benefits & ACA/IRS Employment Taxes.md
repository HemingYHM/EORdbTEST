# IRS Employment Taxes

Federal employment taxes include income tax withholding, Social Security and Medicare taxes (FICA), and federal unemployment tax (FUTA). Employers must properly calculate, withhold, deposit, and report these taxes.

## Types of Employment Taxes

### Federal Income Tax Withholding
**Withholding requirements**:
- Based on employee's Form W-4
- Use IRS withholding tables or percentage method
- Adjust for pay frequency and filing status
- Supplemental wage rates for bonuses/commissions

**Form W-4 updates**:
- New employees must complete within first pay period
- Employees may update anytime
- Employers cannot require specific allowances

### FICA Taxes (Social Security and Medicare)
**Social Security tax (2024)**:
- **Rate**: 6.2% employee + 6.2% employer (12.4% total)
- **Wage base**: $160,200 (indexed annually)
- **No tax on wages above wage base**

**Medicare tax (2024)**:
- **Rate**: 1.45% employee + 1.45% employer (2.9% total)
- **No wage base limit**
- **Additional Medicare tax**: 0.9% on employee wages over $200,000 (employee only)

### Federal Unemployment Tax (FUTA)
**FUTA tax (2024)**:
- **Rate**: 6.0% on first $7,000 of wages per employee

**Common exclusions**:
- Independent contractor payments
- Certain fringe benefits (health insurance, etc.)

- Contributions to qualified retirement plans

## Employee vs. Independent Contractor
**IRS factors** for classification:
- **Behavioral control**: Who controls how work is done?
- **Financial control**: Who controls business aspects?
- **Relationship type**: Written contracts, benefits, permanency

**Form SS-8**: Request IRS determination of worker status
**Consequences of misclassification**: Back taxes, penalties, interest

## Deposit Requirements
**Deposit schedules** based on lookback period:
- **Monthly depositor**: Deposits due by 15th of following month
- **Semi-weekly depositor**: Deposits due Wednesday or Friday
- **Next-day depositor**: Large deposits ($100,000+) due next banking day

**Electronic deposits**: Required through EFTPS (Electronic Federal Tax Payment System)

## Reporting Requirements

### Form 941 (Quarterly)
**Filed quarterly** by last day of month following quarter:
- Reports wages, tips, and taxes for quarter
- Reconciles deposits with tax liability
- Claims credits and adjustments

### Form 940 (Annual FUTA)
**Filed annually** by January 31:

- Calculates net FUTA tax due

### Form W-2 (Annual Wage Statements)
