# Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA)

The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA) established the legal framework for employment verification and employer sanctions. It makes it unlawful to hire unauthorized workers and prohibits employment discrimination based on national origin or citizenship status.

## Key Provisions of IRCA
**Employer sanctions**:
- Makes it unlawful to hire unauthorized workers
- Requires employment eligibility verification (Form I-9)
- Establishes civil and criminal penalties for violations

**Anti-discrimination provisions**:
- Prohibits citizenship status discrimination
- Prohibits national origin discrimination
- Creates enforcement mechanism through DOJ

## Unlawful Employment Practices
### Hiring Unauthorized Workers
**Prohibited conduct**:
- **Knowingly hiring** unauthorized workers
- **Continuing to employ** workers after learning of unauthorized status
- **Pattern or practice** of hiring unauthorized workers

**Knowledge standard**:
- **Actual knowledge**: Employer knows worker is unauthorized
- **Constructive knowledge**: Employer should have known (willful blindness)
- **Document fraud**: Accepting obviously fraudulent documents

### Document-Related Discrimination
**Prohibited practices**:
- Requesting more or different documents than required by law
- Refusing to accept valid documents that reasonably appear genuine
- Treating individuals differently in verification process

**Protected individuals**:
- U.S. citizens
- Nationals
- Lawful permanent residents
- Refugees and asylees
- Other work-authorized individuals

## Employment Verification Requirements
**Form I-9 mandate**:
- All employers must complete Form I-9 for every employee
- Must examine documents establishing identity and work authorization
- Cannot specify which acceptable documents employee must provide
- See [[Form I-9 Requirements]] for detailed requirements

**Timing requirements**:
- Section 1: By end of first day of work
- Section 2: Within 3 business days of hire
- Section 3: As needed for reverification

## Anti-Discrimination Provisions (Section 1324b)
**Citizenship status discrimination**:
- Cannot discriminate based on citizenship status in hiring, firing, or recruitment
- Applies to employers with 4+ employees
- Limited exceptions for positions requiring U.S. citizenship by law

**National origin discrimination**:
- Broader protection than Title VII for small employers
- Applies to employers with 4+ employees (vs. 15+ under Title VII)
- Covers same conduct as Title VII but with different enforcement

**Document abuse**:
- Cannot request specific documents from List A, B, or C
- Cannot reject reasonably genuine documents
- Cannot treat workers differently based on accent, appearance, or name

## Enforcement and Penalties
### Civil Penalties for Employer Sanctions
**Paperwork violations** (per employee):
- **First offense**: $252 to $2,507
- **Second offense**: $2,507 to $6,268
- **Third+ offense**: $3,760 to $15,041

**Substantive violations** (per employee):
- **First offense**: $563 to $5,626
- **Second offense**: $5,626 to $14,064
- **Third+ offense**: $8,439 to $22,105

### Criminal Penalties
**Pattern or practice violations**:
- Felony charges for systematic violations
- Up to 6 months imprisonment per alien
- Fines up to $3,000 per alien

**Document fraud**:
- Criminal penalties for fraudulent document use
- Conspiracy charges for organized fraud schemes

### Anti-Discrimination Penalties
**Administrative penalties**:
- Back pay for affected individuals
- Civil penalties up to $4,667 per individual
- Compliance orders and monitoring

**Pattern or practice discrimination**:
- Enhanced penalties for systematic discrimination
- Court-ordered remedial measures

## Good Faith Defense
**Compliance defense**:
- Good faith compliance with Form I-9 requirements
- Protection against sanctions if reasonable verification conducted
- Must examine documents that reasonably appear genuine

**Limitations**:
- Does not protect against obvious document fraud
- Must follow proper procedures consistently
- Cannot ignore clear evidence of unauthorized status

## Relationship to Other Laws
**Title VII coordination**:
- IRCA covers smaller employers (4+ vs. 15+)
- Same conduct may violate both laws
- Different enforcement agencies (DOJ vs. EEOC)

**State employment laws**:
- Federal law preempts conflicting state requirements
- States may have additional verification requirements
- Some states prohibit E-Verify mandates

## Special Situations
**Temporary workers**:
- Must verify work authorization for all temporary workers
- Seasonal workers subject to same requirements
- Staffing agencies responsible for verification

**Remote workers**:
- Must complete I-9 verification regardless of work location
- Document examination requirements still apply
- Consider authorized representative procedures

**Mergers and acquisitions**:
- Acquiring company inherits I-9 obligations
- Due diligence should include I-9 compliance review
- Potential liability for predecessor's violations

## Best Practices for IRCA Compliance
**Policies and procedures**:
- Develop written I-9 and anti-discrimination policies
- Train HR personnel on proper verification procedures
- Establish consistent practices for all employees
- Regular policy updates and training refreshers

**Documentation and record-keeping**:
- Maintain complete and accurate I-9 forms
- Document training and policy communications
- Keep records separate from personnel files
- Implement record retention procedures

**Internal monitoring**:
- Conduct regular I-9 self-audits
- Monitor for discriminatory practices
- Investigate and correct violations promptly
- Consider third-party compliance reviews

## Enforcement Trends
**ICE enforcement priorities**:
- I-9 audits and workplace investigations
- Focus on employers with compliance violations
- Increased penalties for repeat offenders

**DOJ enforcement**:
- Pattern and practice discrimination cases
- Document abuse investigations
- Coordination with other civil rights enforcement

## Technology and IRCA
**Electronic verification**:
- E-Verify supplements but doesn't replace I-9
- Electronic I-9 storage permitted with safeguards
- Technology can help ensure consistent practices

**Emerging issues**:
- Artificial intelligence in hiring decisions
- Remote verification challenges
- Digital document fraud

## EOR-Specific Considerations
**Responsibility allocation**:
- EOR typically responsible for I-9 compliance
- Client should not complete verification for EOR employees
- Clear contractual allocation prevents confusion

**Joint employer issues**:
- Both entities may be liable for violations
- Coordinate to avoid discriminatory practices
- Document respective responsibilities clearly

## Employer Checklist
- Implement comprehensive I-9 compliance program
- Train all personnel involved in hiring and verification
- Establish consistent, non-discriminatory practices
- Conduct regular internal I-9 audits
- Maintain proper documentation and records
- Monitor for changes in law and enforcement
- Respond promptly to government investigations
- Consider legal counsel for compliance reviews

## Recent Developments
**Regulatory updates**: USCIS continues to update I-9 and verification guidance
**Enforcement changes**: ICE and DOJ enforcement priorities and procedures
**Legislative proposals**: Potential comprehensive immigration reform
**Technology guidance**: Electronic verification and storage requirements
