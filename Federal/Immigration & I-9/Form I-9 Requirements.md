# Form I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification Requirements

Form I-9 is used to verify the identity and employment authorization of individuals hired for employment in the United States. All U.S. employers must complete and retain Form I-9 for every employee.

## Employer Requirements
**All U.S. employers** must complete Form I-9:
- **No size threshold**: Applies to all employers regardless of number of employees
- **All employees**: U.S. citizens and noncitizens
- **No exceptions**: Including part-time, temporary, and seasonal workers

**Timing requirements**:
- **Section 1**: Employee completes by first day of work
- **Section 2**: Employer completes within 3 business days of hire

## Employee Responsibilities (Section 1)

3. Lawful permanent resident
4. Alien authorized to work (with expiration date if applicable)

## Employer Responsibilities (Section 2)
**Document examination**:
- **Physical examination**: Must physically examine documents
- **Original documents**: No photocopies (except certified copies from issuing agency)
- **Reasonably genuine**: Documents must appear genuine and relate to employee

**List of Acceptable Documents**:
- **List A**: Documents establishing both identity and work authorization
- **List B**: Documents establishing identity only (plus List C document)
- **List C**: Documents establishing work authorization only (plus List B document)

### List A Documents (Identity and Work Authorization)

## Prohibited Practices
**Document discrimination**:
- Cannot specify which acceptable documents employee must provide
- Cannot reject reasonably genuine documents
- Cannot treat individuals differently based on citizenship status
- Cannot require more or different documents than legally required

**Citizenship status discrimination**:
- Cannot discriminate based on national origin or citizenship status
- Must accept any acceptable document from Lists A, B, or C
- Cannot require specific documents unless required by law

## Remote Employees and Alternative Procedures
**COVID-19 flexibility** (temporary):
- Remote examination of documents permitted during public health emergency
- Must examine original documents when normal operations resume
- Alternative procedures must be consistent and applied uniformly

**Standard remote procedures**:
- Generally must examine documents in person
- Limited exceptions for certain circumstances
- Consider authorized representative procedures

## Record-Keeping Requirements
**Retention period**:
- **3 years from hire date** OR
- **1 year after termination**
- Whichever is later

**Storage requirements**:
- Keep forms readily available for inspection
- May store electronically with proper safeguards
- Separate from personnel files (recommended)
- Maintain confidentiality of information

## Section 3 - Reverification and Rehires
**When required**:
- Work authorization expires (as shown in Section 1)
- Employee's name changes
- Rehiring employee with expired work authorization

**When NOT required**:
- U.S. citizens (never need reverification)
- Lawful permanent residents (unless card expires and employee cannot provide updated card)
- Document expiration (if work authorization continues)

## E-Verify Integration
**Relationship to Form I-9**:
- E-Verify supplements but does not replace Form I-9
- Form I-9 must be completed first
- E-Verify queries run after Form I-9 completion
- See [[E-Verify Program]] for detailed requirements

## Common Compliance Violations
**Form completion errors**:
- Missing signatures or dates
- Incomplete employee information
- Incorrect document information
- Failing to complete within required timeframes

**Document examination failures**:
- Accepting photocopies instead of originals
- Failing to examine documents at all
- Accepting clearly fraudulent documents
- Discriminatory document practices

## Enforcement and Penalties
**ICE enforcement**:
- Form I-9 audits and inspections
- Notice of Inspection (NOI) process
- Administrative and criminal penalties

**Civil penalties** (per violation):
- **Paperwork violations**: $252 to $2,507 per form
- **Substantive violations**: $563 to $5,626 per employee
- **Repeat offenders**: Enhanced penalties

**Criminal penalties**:
- Pattern or practice of violations
- Up to 6 months imprisonment and fines

## Best Practices for Compliance
**Training and procedures**:
- Designate trained HR personnel for I-9 completion
- Establish consistent procedures for all employees
- Regular training updates on acceptable documents
- Monitor for discriminatory practices

**Internal audits**:
- Conduct regular self-audits of I-9 forms
- Correct errors promptly
- Document corrective actions taken
- Consider third-party compliance reviews

## Technology and I-9 Compliance
**Electronic I-9 systems**:
- Must meet specific regulatory requirements
- Electronic signatures permitted with safeguards
- Audit trail and tamper-evident systems required
- Employee access to completed forms

**Document storage**:
- Electronic storage permitted with proper controls
- Original documents still must be examined
- Backup and retention procedures required

## Multi-Location Employers
**Centralized vs. decentralized**:
- May centralize I-9 completion and storage
- Local management may handle completion
- Consistent procedures across all locations
- Training for all personnel involved

## EOR-Specific Considerations
**Responsibility allocation**:
- EOR typically responsible for I-9 compliance
- Client companies should not complete I-9 forms
- Clear contractual allocation of responsibilities
- Joint employer considerations for compliance

**Remote workforce**:
- Challenges with document examination
- Consider authorized representative procedures
- Technology solutions for compliance
- State law variations on remote verification
