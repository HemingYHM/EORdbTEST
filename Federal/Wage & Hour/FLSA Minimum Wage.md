# FLSA Minimum Wage

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes the federal minimum wage, which applies to most employees in the United States. Employers must pay employees at least the federal minimum wage unless a higher state or local minimum wage applies. As of July 24, 2009, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.

## Employer Checklist
- Pay all covered, non-exempt employees at least $7.25/hour.
- Monitor state and local laws for higher minimum wage rates.
- Maintain accurate payroll records (see [[Recordkeeping (FLSA)]]).
- Ensure tipped employees meet minimum wage after tip credits (see [[Tipped Employees]]).
