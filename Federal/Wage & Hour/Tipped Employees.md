# FLSA Tipped Employee Rules

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) allows employers to pay tipped employees a reduced cash wage, provided the employee receives enough tips to meet the federal minimum wage. This is known as the "tip credit" provision.

## Federal Tip Credit Rules
- **Minimum cash wage**: $2.13 per hour (as of 2009)
- **Maximum tip credit**: $5.12 per hour
- **Combined minimum**: Cash wage + tips must equal $7.25/hour
- **Tip threshold**: Employee must receive more than $30/month in tips

## Qualifying Tipped Employees
- Employees who customarily and regularly receive more than $30/month in tips
- Common positions: servers, bartenders, bellhops, valets, hairstylists
- Must spend majority of time in tip-producing activities

## Employer Requirements
- **Notice**: Inform employees of tip credit provisions
- **Make up the difference**: If tips + cash wage < minimum wage, employer must pay difference
- **Tip pooling**: Only among employees who customarily receive tips
- **Record maintenance**: Track tips received (see [[Recordkeeping (FLSA)]])

## Prohibited Practices
- **Tip retention**: Employers cannot keep any portion of tips (except valid tip pooling)
- **Mandatory tip pools**: Including non-tipped employees (managers, kitchen staff)
- **Tip credit for overtime**: Must pay full minimum wage for overtime calculation

## State Variations
Some states prohibit tip credits entirely:
- **No tip credit states**: Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington
- **Higher cash wages**: Many states require higher cash wages than federal $2.13

## Employer Checklist
- Determine if state allows tip credit
- Provide required notice to tipped employees
- Track daily tips received by each employee
- Ensure minimum wage is met each pay period
- Maintain separate records for tipped employees
- Train managers on tip credit compliance
