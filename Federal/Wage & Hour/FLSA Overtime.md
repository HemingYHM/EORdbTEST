# FLSA Overtime

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires covered, non-exempt employees to receive overtime pay at a rate of not less than time and one-half their regular rates of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

## Key Requirements
- **40-hour threshold**: Overtime begins after 40 hours in a workweek
- **Rate**: 1.5x regular rate of pay
- **Workweek**: Fixed 168-hour period (7 consecutive 24-hour periods)
- **No daily overtime** at federal level (unlike some states)

## Exempt vs. Non-Exempt
Certain employees are exempt from overtime requirements:
- Executive, administrative, professional employees (white-collar exemptions)
- Computer professionals
- Outside sales employees
- Highly compensated employees ($107,432+ annually as of 2022)

## Employer Checklist
- Classify employees correctly as exempt or non-exempt
- Track all hours worked for non-exempt employees
- Pay overtime at 1.5x regular rate for hours over 40/week
- Maintain accurate records (see [[Recordkeeping (FLSA)]])
- Ensure salary basis test is met for exempt employees
