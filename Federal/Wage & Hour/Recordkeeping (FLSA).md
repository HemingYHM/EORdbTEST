# FLSA Recordkeeping Requirements

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to keep certain records for each covered, non-exempt worker. Records must be maintained for at least three years, with payroll records kept for at least two years.

## Required Records (3 years)
- Employee's full name and social security number
- Address, including zip code
- Birth date (if younger than 19)
- Sex and occupation
- Time and day of week when employee's workweek begins
- Hours worked each day and total hours worked each workweek
- Basis on which employee's wages are paid
- Regular hourly pay rate
- Total daily or weekly straight-time earnings
- Total overtime earnings for the workweek
- All additions to or deductions from the employee's wages
- Total wages paid each pay period
- Date of payment and the pay period covered by the payment

## Additional Records (2 years)
- Basic employment and earnings records
- Wage rate tables
- Work time schedules
- Records of additions to or deductions from wages
- Records explaining basis of payment of any wage differential to employees of opposite sex in same establishment

## Special Considerations
- **Tipped Employees**: Additional records for tip reporting (see [[Tipped Employees]])
- **Child Labor**: Birth certificates or age verification (see [[Child Labor Rules]])
- **Remote Workers**: Track hours worked regardless of location

## Employer Checklist
- Implement timekeeping system for all non-exempt employees
- Maintain records for required retention periods
- Ensure records are readily available for DOL inspection
- Document any wage deductions with proper authorization
- Keep records in accessible format (physical or electronic)
