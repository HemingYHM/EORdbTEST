# Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) - Title II Employment

GINA prohibits employment discrimination based on genetic information and restricts employers from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information about employees or their family members.

## What is Genetic Information?
**Includes**:
- Information about individual's genetic tests
- Information about genetic tests of family members (up to 4th degree relatives)
- Requests for or receipt of genetic services by individual or family members
- Genetic information about fetus during pregnancy
- Genetic information about embryo during assisted reproductive technology
- **Family medical history**: Most common form of genetic information

## Employer Coverage
- **Private employers**: 15+ employees
- **Federal government**: All agencies
- **State and local government**: All entities
- **Employment agencies**: Serving covered employers
- **Labor unions**: All covered
- **Joint labor-management training programs**: All covered

## Prohibited Practices
**Cannot use genetic information** for:
- Hiring decisions
- Firing decisions
- Job assignments
- Promotions
- Layoffs
- Training opportunities
- Fringe benefits
- Any other term, condition, or privilege of employment

## Acquisition Restrictions
**Generally prohibited** from requesting, requiring, or purchasing genetic information

**Six narrow exceptions**:
1. **Inadvertent acquisition**: Unintentional receipt during permissible medical inquiries
2. **Health/genetic services**: Voluntary wellness programs with strict requirements
3. **FMLA or similar leave**: Certification for family member's serious health condition
4. **Publicly available information**: Commercial sources, newspapers (not medical databases)
5. **Workplace monitoring**: Genetic monitoring for effects of toxic substances (voluntary only)
6. **Law enforcement**: DNA testing for identity, paternity, or criminal investigations

## Confidentiality Requirements
**Genetic information must be**:
- Kept confidential
- Stored separately from personnel files
- Treated as confidential medical record
- Limited access similar to ADA medical information

**Access permitted only to**:
- Employees receiving genetic services (about themselves)
- Occupational health researchers (de-identified)
- Government officials investigating GINA compliance
- In response to court order (notice required to employee)

## Wellness Programs
**Voluntary genetic services** in workplace wellness programs:
- Must be truly voluntary
- Cannot require participation for employment benefits
- Must provide specific written notice
- Genetic information cannot be used for underwriting purposes
- Must comply with confidentiality requirements

## Family Medical History
**Most common violation area**:
- Asking "How is your family?" during casual conversation
- Requesting family medical history on health forms
- Following up on employee's mention of family illness
- Genetic counseling referrals based on family history

## Safe Harbor Practices
**To avoid inadvertent acquisition**:
- Train supervisors not to ask follow-up questions about family medical history
- Include warning on medical inquiry forms
- Use specific, limited questions for FMLA certifications
- Avoid broad medical inquiries that might elicit genetic information

## Warning Language
**Recommended warning** for medical forms:
"The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits employers and other entities covered by GINA Title II from requesting or requiring genetic information of an individual or family member of the individual, except as specifically allowed by this law. To comply with this law, we are asking that you not provide any genetic information when responding to this request for medical information..."

## Harassment Protection

- Opposing practices made unlawful by GINA
- Testifying in GINA investigations

## Employer Checklist
- Train supervisors on GINA requirements and prohibited inquiries
- Review medical inquiry forms for genetic information requests
- Add GINA warning language to medical forms
- Ensure genetic information is stored separately and confidentially
- Establish procedures for inadvertent genetic information acquisition
- Review wellness programs for GINA compliance

## Common Mistakes
