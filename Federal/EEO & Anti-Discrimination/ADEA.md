# Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)

The ADEA prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older. It applies to employers with 20 or more employees, employment agencies, labor unions, and federal/state/local governments.

## Protected Class
- **Age 40 and older**: All individuals age 40+ are protected
- **No upper limit**: Protection continues regardless of age
- **Younger workers**: Generally not protected (some state laws may differ)

## Employer Coverage
- **Private employers**: 20+ employees for 20+ weeks in current or preceding year
- **Federal government**: All agencies covered
- **State and local government**: All covered
- **Employment agencies**: Serving covered employers
- **Labor unions**: 25+ members

## Prohibited Practices
- **Hiring discrimination**: Age-based hiring decisions
- **Firing**: Termination due to age
- **Compensation**: Age-based pay differences
- **Terms and conditions**: Different treatment based on age
- **Harassment**: Age-based hostile work environment
- **Retaliation**: For filing ADEA complaints or participating in proceedings

## Disparate Impact
**Facially neutral practices** that disproportionately affect workers 40+:
- **Reasonable factors other than age (RFOA)**: Employer defense
- **Business necessity**: Not required under ADEA (unlike Title VII)
- **Examples**: Physical requirements, technology requirements, educational requirements

## Bona Fide Occupational Qualification (BFOQ)
**Very narrow exception**:
- Age must be reasonably necessary for normal business operation
- **Examples**: Actor for young role, safety considerations for certain positions
- **Cannot use**: Cost savings, customer preference, stereotypes about older workers

## Waivers and Releases
**Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA) Requirements**:
- **Written agreement**: Must be in writing and understandable
- **Specific claims**: Must specifically reference ADEA claims
- **21-day consideration**: Individual has 21 days to consider (45 days for group programs)
- **7-day revocation**: Can revoke within 7 days after signing
- **Valuable consideration**: Must receive something of value beyond what entitled to

## Early Retirement Incentives
**Voluntary programs** that:
- Encourage voluntary retirement
- Supplement pension/benefits
- Must be truly voluntary (no coercion)
- Cannot target individuals based on age stereotypes

## Employee Benefits
**Equal benefit or equal cost principle**:
- Employer may provide equal benefits OR spend equal amounts
- **Life insurance**: May provide less coverage for older workers if costs more
- **Health insurance**: Generally must provide equal coverage
- **Pension plans**: ADEA allows some age-based provisions

## Mandatory Retirement
**Generally prohibited** except:
- **Executives/high policymakers**: Age 65+ with pension benefits of $44,000+ annually
- **Public safety**: Police, firefighters where age is BFOQ
- **Federal employees**: Some specific positions (air traffic controllers, etc.)

## Enforcement Process
**EEOC Procedures**:
- **Charge filing**: 180 days (300 days in deferral states)
- **Investigation**: EEOC investigates discrimination claims
- **Conciliation**: Attempt voluntary resolution
- **Right to sue**: Can file suit in federal court

- Ensure layoff criteria are age-neutral
- Review benefit plans for ADEA compliance

- **Stereotyping**: Assumptions about older workers' abilities
- **Layoff targeting**: Disproportionate impact on older workers
- **Benefit reductions**: Unlawful cuts to older workers' benefits
- **Involuntary retirement**: Forcing retirement based on age
