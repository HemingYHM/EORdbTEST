# Equal Pay Act of 1963

The Equal Pay Act (EPA) requires that men and women be given equal pay for equal work in the same establishment. It is an amendment to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and prohibits sex-based wage discrimination.

## Basic Requirement
**Equal pay for equal work**:
- Same establishment
- Jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility
- Performed under similar working conditions
- No wage differentials based on sex

## Elements of Equal Work
**Skill**: Experience, training, education, and ability required to perform job
**Effort**: Physical or mental exertion needed
**Responsibility**: Degree of accountability required
**Working Conditions**: Physical surroundings and hazards

## Employer Coverage
- **Same as FLSA**: Employers engaged in interstate commerce
- **$500,000+ annual revenue**: Automatic coverage
- **Smaller employers**: May be covered based on interstate commerce activities
- **Government**: Federal, state, and local governments covered

## Permissible Pay Differentials
**Four affirmative defenses**:
1. **Seniority system**: Bona fide seniority system
2. **Merit system**: Bona fide merit system
3. **System measuring quantity/quality**: Piece-rate or productivity-based pay
4. **Factor other than sex**: Any legitimate factor other than sex

## "Factor Other Than Sex" Defense
**Must be**:
- Job-related
- Based on legitimate business reason
- Applied reasonably
- Account for entire wage differential

**Examples**:
- Education and experience
- Training
- Different shifts or locations
- Temporary assignments
- Market forces (with limitations)

## Retaliation Protection
**Prohibited actions** against employees who:
- File EPA complaints
- Testify in EPA proceedings
- Oppose discriminatory practices
- Participate in EPA investigations

## Relationship to Title VII
**Overlapping coverage**:
- EPA: Sex-based wage discrimination specifically
- Title VII: Broader sex discrimination including compensation
- **Both may apply**: Employees can file under both laws
- **Bennett Amendment**: Title VII incorporates EPA's affirmative defenses

## Remedies
**Available relief**:
- **Back pay**: Difference in wages for up to 2 years (3 years if willful)
- **Liquidated damages**: Additional amount equal to back pay
- **Prospective pay equity**: Raise pay of underpaid employees
- **Attorney fees**: For prevailing plaintiffs
- **Injunctive relief**: Policy changes

**No reduction allowed**: Cannot lower higher-paid employees' wages to achieve equality

## Enforcement Options
**EEOC enforcement**:
- File charge with EEOC (180/300 days)
- EEOC investigation and conciliation
- EEOC may file lawsuit

**Private lawsuit**:
- File directly in federal court
- No requirement to file EEOC charge first
- 2-year statute of limitations (3 years if willful)

## Common Violations
- **Salary history reliance**: Using prior salary to justify pay differences
- **Job title differences**: Different titles for substantially equal work
- **Gender-coded positions**: Separate job classifications by gender
- **Benefit disparities**: Unequal fringe benefits based on sex

## Best Practices for Compliance
**Pay equity audits**:
- Regular analysis of compensation data
- Identify unexplained gender pay gaps
- Document legitimate reasons for pay differences
- Address identified disparities

**Job evaluation systems**:
- Objective job analysis and classification
- Consistent application of criteria
- Regular review and updating
- Documentation of evaluation process

## Employer Checklist
- Conduct regular pay equity analyses
- Review job descriptions for accuracy
- Ensure compensation systems are gender-neutral
- Train HR staff on EPA requirements
- Document legitimate reasons for pay differences
- Prohibit salary history inquiries where legally required
- Establish complaint procedures for pay equity issues
- Maintain accurate payroll records per FLSA requirements

## State and Local Considerations
**Enhanced protections** in many jurisdictions:
- **Salary history bans**: Prohibited in many states/cities
- **Broader comparisons**: Beyond "equal work" to "comparable work"
- **Enhanced penalties**: Greater damages and penalties
- **Reporting requirements**: Pay data reporting in some jurisdictions
