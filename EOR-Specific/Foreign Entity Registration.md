# Foreign Entity Registration for EOR Services

Employer of Record (EOR) providers must comply with state business registration requirements when providing services across multiple states. This includes foreign entity registration, business licensing, and ongoing compliance obligations.

## What is Foreign Entity Registration?
**Definition**: Registration required when a business entity operates in a state other than its state of incorporation/formation

**EOR Context**: EOR companies typically:

- Must register as "foreign entity" in each service state

## State Registration Requirements

- Having physical presence or offices
- Providing ongoing services to clients in the state

**Activities triggering registration**:
- Hiring and employing workers
- Maintaining payroll systems
- Administering employee benefits
- Managing workers' compensation coverage

## Typical Registration Process
**Initial registration**:
1. **Application filing** with Secretary of State
2. **Certificate of Good Standing** from home state
3. **Registered agent** appointment in foreign state
