## Commission and Bonus Payments
**Earned commissions**: Must be paid according to agreement terms

## Vacation and PTO Payout
**No legal requirement**: Texas does not require vacation payout upon termination

**Written policies**: Establish clear vacation and PTO policies

## Wage Payment Methods
**Acceptable methods**:
