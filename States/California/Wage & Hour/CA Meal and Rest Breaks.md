# California Meal and Rest Break Requirements

California requires employers to provide meal and rest breaks to non-exempt employees, with specific timing, duration, and premium pay requirements that exceed federal standards.

## Rest Break Requirements
**10-minute paid rest breaks**:
- One break for shifts over 3.5 hours
- Two breaks for shifts over 6 hours
- Three breaks for shifts over 10 hours
- Four breaks for shifts over 14 hours

**Timing**:
- Should fall in middle of work period
- Cannot be combined with meal periods
- Cannot be required at beginning or end of shift

## Meal Break Requirements
**30-minute unpaid meal breaks**:
- First break: Before end of 5th hour of work
- Second break: Before end of 10th hour of work
- Employee must be relieved of all duties
- Free to leave the premises

**Meal period waivers**:
- **First meal period**: Can be waived if shift ≤ 6 hours (by mutual consent)
- **Second meal period**: Can be waived if shift ≤ 12 hours and first meal taken

## Premium Pay for Violations
**One additional hour of pay** at regular rate for each:
- Missed or late meal period
- Missed or inadequate rest period
- Maximum: One hour for meal violations + one hour for rest violations per day

**Not considered wages**: Premium pay is separate from regular wages for most purposes

## Industry-Specific Variations
**Healthcare workers**: Different break requirements for certain facilities
**Agricultural workers**: Modified meal and rest break schedules
**Commercial drivers**: DOT regulations may preempt some requirements
**Motion picture industry**: Collective bargaining agreement variations

## On-Duty Meal Periods
**Permitted when**:
- Nature of work prevents relief from duties
- Written agreement between employer and employee
- Can be revoked by employee at any time
- Must be paid time

**Common positions**: Security guards, sole employees, certain healthcare workers

## Lactation Accommodation
**Additional requirements**:
- Reasonable break time for expressing milk
- Private location (not bathroom)
- Coordinate with regular break periods when possible
- Unpaid unless taken during paid break time

## Employer Obligations
**Policy requirements**:
- Written meal and rest break policies
- Train supervisors on break requirements
- Track and document break periods
- Systems to prevent automatic deductions

**Scheduling considerations**:
- Plan work schedules around break requirements
- Avoid requiring employees to work through breaks
- Monitor compliance through timekeeping systems

## Common Violations
**Timing violations**:
- Providing meal break after 5th hour
- Combining rest breaks with meal periods
- Requiring work during meal periods

**Documentation failures**:
- Automatic meal deductions without verification
- Inadequate break period tracking
- Missing signed meal period waivers

## Compliance Best Practices
**Timekeeping systems**:
- Track actual break times taken
- Flag potential violations automatically
- Require confirmation of meal periods

**Training programs**:
- Supervisor training on break law compliance
- Employee education on break rights
- Regular policy updates and refreshers

## Penalties and Enforcement
**DLSE enforcement**:
- Investigate meal and rest break complaints
- Order payment of premium wages
- Civil penalties for willful violations

**Private lawsuits**:
- Class action lawsuits common
- Recovery of unpaid premium wages
- Attorney fees for prevailing employees

**PAGA claims**:
- Private Attorneys General Act penalties
- $50-$100 per violation per pay period
- Additional civil penalties

## Multi-State Considerations
**EOR implications**:
- CA employees require CA break compliance regardless of EOR location
- Different systems needed for CA vs. other state employees
- Consider joint employer liability for break violations

## Technology Solutions
**Automated systems**:
- Break reminder notifications
- Automatic premium pay calculations
- Compliance reporting and alerts
- Integration with payroll systems

## Recent Developments
**Court decisions**: Ongoing clarification of break law requirements
**Regulatory updates**: DLSE guidance on implementation
**Legislative changes**: Potential modifications to break requirements

## Employer Checklist
- Establish written meal and rest break policies
- Train all supervisors on break law requirements
- Implement timekeeping systems that track actual breaks
- Avoid automatic meal deductions without verification
- Calculate and pay premium wages for violations
- Maintain documentation of break periods and waivers
- Regular compliance audits and system reviews
- Coordinate with legal counsel on policy updates
