# California Daily Overtime Rules

California requires overtime pay for work exceeding 8 hours in a day or 40 hours in a week, whichever provides greater compensation. California also requires double-time pay in certain circumstances.

## Daily Overtime Requirements
**Time-and-a-half (1.5x) pay required for**:
- Hours worked over **8 in a workday**
- Hours worked over **40 in a workweek**
- **First 8 hours on 7th consecutive day** of work in a workweek

**Double-time (2x) pay required for**:
- Hours worked over **12 in a workday**
- Hours worked over **8 hours on 7th consecutive day** of work in a workweek

## Workday and Workweek Definitions
**Workday**: Any consecutive 24-hour period starting at same time each day
**Workweek**: Seven consecutive 24-hour periods starting at same time each week
**Employer discretion**: Can establish starting times, must be consistent

## Alternative Workweek Schedules
**Four 10-hour days**: Permitted with proper election process
- **No daily overtime** for first 10 hours
- Overtime begins after 10 hours in a day
- Still subject to 40-hour weekly overtime
- Requires 2/3 employee vote and DLSE filing

**Other alternative schedules**: Possible with compliance procedures

## Meal Period Impact on Overtime
**Meal periods not counted** as hours worked if:
- At least 30 minutes
- Employee relieved of all duties
- Free to leave premises
- **If meal period requirements violated**, additional hour of pay required (see [[CA Meal and Rest Breaks]])

## Exempt Employees
**California exemptions** (stricter than federal):
- **Salary threshold**: 2x California minimum wage for full-time work
- **2024 threshold**: $66,560 annually ($1,280/week)
- Must meet federal and state duties tests
- **Computer professionals**: Higher salary threshold and specific duties
- **Outside sales**: Same as federal exemption

## Calculating Regular Rate
**Must include** in regular rate calculation:
- Base hourly wages or salary
- Non-discretionary bonuses
- Commissions
- Piece-rate earnings
- Shift differentials

**Excludes**:
- Discretionary bonuses
- Gifts and special occasion bonuses
- Reimbursements for expenses

## Common California-Specific Issues
**Split shifts**: Additional compensation required if non-consecutive work periods
**Reporting time**: Minimum pay requirements for scheduled shifts
**Travel time**: Different rules than federal law for intrastate travel
**On-call time**: Specific California requirements for standby time

## Comparison to Federal Law
**California more protective**:
- Daily overtime (federal has none)
- Double-time requirements (federal has none)
- Higher salary thresholds for exemptions
- Stricter duties tests for exemptions
- Additional meal and rest break requirements

## Record-Keeping Requirements
**Enhanced California requirements**:
- Track daily hours worked, not just weekly
- Record start and end times for each workday
- Document meal and rest periods
- Maintain records for 3 years minimum

## Employer Checklist
- Implement daily time tracking for all non-exempt employees
- Calculate overtime based on both daily and weekly thresholds
- Pay the higher overtime amount when both apply
- Ensure exempt employees meet California salary and duties tests
- Train supervisors on California-specific overtime rules
- Review alternative workweek arrangements for compliance
- Maintain detailed time records per California requirements

## Penalties for Violations
**Unpaid overtime**: Full amount owed plus interest
**Waiting time penalties**: Up to 30 days' wages for final paycheck violations
**Liquidated damages**: Additional penalty equal to unpaid wages
**PAGA penalties**: $50-$100 per violation per pay period for missed overtime
**Attorney fees**: Available to prevailing employees

## Industry-Specific Considerations
**Healthcare workers**: Special overtime rules for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities
**Agricultural workers**: Different overtime thresholds (phasing in)
**Domestic workers**: Subject to overtime rules with limited exceptions
**Transportation**: Various exemptions and special rules

## Multi-State Employer Considerations
**California law applies**:
- To all work performed in California
- Regardless of employee's home state
- Even for brief assignments or travel to California
- Consider joint employer issues for staffing arrangements
