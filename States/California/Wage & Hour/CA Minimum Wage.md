# California Minimum Wage

California requires a higher minimum wage than federal law and prohibits tip credits. Many cities and counties have enacted even higher local minimum wage ordinances that may apply.

## Current California Minimum Wage
**As of January 1, 2024**:
- **All employers**: $16.00 per hour (no distinction by employer size)
- **No tip credit**: Tipped employees must receive full minimum wage plus tips
- **Annual increases**: Scheduled increases through 2025

## No Tip Credit Allowed
**California prohibition**:
- Cannot use tip credit to reduce wages below minimum wage
- Tipped employees must receive at least $16.00/hour (2024 rate) plus tips
- Significantly different from federal law (see [[Tipped Employees]])

## Local Minimum Wage Ordinances
**Higher local rates may apply**:
- **Los Angeles**: Various rates by business size and location
- **San Francisco**: $18.07/hour (2024)
- **Oakland**: $16.50/hour (2024)
- **San Diego**: $17.00/hour (2024)
- **Berkeley**: $18.67/hour (2024)

- More stringent record-keeping requirements

## Penalties for Violations
