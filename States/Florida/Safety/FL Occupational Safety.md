# Florida Occupational Safety and Health Act

Florida operates under federal OSHA jurisdiction but has specific state safety requirements and programs that supplement federal workplace safety protections.

## Regulatory Framework
**Federal OSHA jurisdiction**: Florida does not operate an OSHA State Plan
**Federal enforcement**: Federal OSHA enforces workplace safety in private sector
**State and local government**: Florida OSHA program covers public sector employees

## Federal OSHA Coverage in Florida
**Private sector employers**: All covered by federal OSHA standards
**General duty clause**: Employers must provide safe workplace free from recognized hazards
**Specific standards**: Industry-specific safety and health standards apply

## State and Local Government Coverage
**Florida OSHA program**:
- Covers state and local government employees
- Administered by Florida Department of Commerce
- Standards at least as effective as federal OSHA

## Key Safety Requirements
**General workplace safety**:
- Hazard communication programs
- Personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Emergency action plans
- Machine guarding and lockout/tagout
- Electrical safety standards

**Industry-specific requirements**:
- Construction safety standards
- Maritime and port safety
- Agricultural safety requirements
- Tourism and hospitality safety

## Construction Industry
**High-risk activities**: Construction is major industry in Florida
**Fall protection**: Requirements for work at height
**Electrical safety**: Specific requirements for electrical work
**Heat illness prevention**: Important in Florida climate

## Agriculture Safety
**Significant agricultural sector**: Citrus, sugarcane, vegetables
**Pesticide safety**: Coordination with environmental regulations
**Machinery safety**: Agricultural equipment requirements
**Heat stress prevention**: Critical in Florida agricultural work

## Tourism Industry Safety
**Hotel and restaurant safety**: Large hospitality sector
**Pool and water safety**: Specific requirements for aquatic facilities
**Crowd management**: Theme park and entertainment venue safety
**Transportation safety**: Tour operators and charter services

## Heat Illness Prevention
**Florida climate considerations**:
- High temperatures and humidity
- Outdoor work protections
- Adequate water and rest breaks
- Heat illness recognition and response

## Inspection and Enforcement
**Federal OSHA inspections**: Private sector workplace inspections
**State inspections**: Public sector workplace inspections
**Complaint-driven**: Employee complaints trigger inspections
**Programmed inspections**: High-hazard industries targeted

## Employee Rights
**Right to safe workplace**: Free from recognized hazards
**Right to information**: Hazard communication and training
**Right to file complaints**: OSHA complaint filing
**Anti-retaliation**: Protection for safety complaints and activities

## Violation Classifications and Penalties
**Federal OSHA penalties**: Apply to private sector violations
**Serious violations**: Substantial probability of serious harm
**Willful violations**: Intentional or knowing violations
**Repeat violations**: Same or similar violations at same workplace

## Workers' Compensation Coordination
**Injury reporting**: Coordination with workers' comp reporting

**Premium impacts**: Safety violations may affect insurance rates

## Record-Keeping Requirements
**OSHA 300 Log**: Record workplace injuries and illnesses
**Injury reporting**: Report severe injuries and fatalities
**Training records**: Document safety training provided
**Inspection records**: Maintain inspection and correction records

## Emergency Preparedness
**Hurricane preparedness**: Critical in Florida
- Emergency action plans
- Evacuation procedures

- Employee communication systems

**Severe weather response**: Thunderstorms, tornadoes, flooding

## Multi-State Considerations
**EOR implications**:
- Florida employees covered by federal OSHA standards
- Coordination with state plan states where EOR operates
- Consistent safety programs across locations

## Seasonal Workforce Safety
**Tourism and agriculture**: High seasonal employment
**Training challenges**: Rapid hiring and turnover
**Language barriers**: Multilingual safety training needs
**Temporary housing**: Migrant worker housing safety

## Best Practices
**Safety program development**:
- Written safety and health programs

- Employee safety training programs
- Incident investigation procedures

**Management commitment**:
- Leadership engagement in safety
- Safety performance metrics
- Regular safety meetings and communication

## Technology and Safety Management
**Safety management systems**:
- Digital incident reporting
- Training tracking systems
- Hazard identification tools
- Compliance monitoring software

## Common Violations in Florida
**Heat-related violations**: Inadequate heat illness prevention
**Fall protection**: Construction industry violations
**Hazard communication**: Chemical safety training failures
**PPE violations**: Inadequate personal protective equipment

## Industry-Specific Considerations
**Construction**: High injury rates, fall protection critical
**Agriculture**: Heat stress, machinery, pesticide exposure
**Tourism**: Pool safety, crowd management, ergonomics
**Manufacturing**: Machine guarding, confined spaces
