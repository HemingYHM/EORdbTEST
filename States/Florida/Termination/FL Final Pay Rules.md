# Florida Final Pay Rules

Florida follows federal wage payment requirements with no additional state-mandated final pay timeline, providing employers flexibility in final paycheck timing while ensuring all earned wages are paid.

## Final Paycheck Timing
**No accelerated deadline**: Florida has no law requiring immediate final pay
**Next regular payday**: Final wages due on next regularly scheduled payday
**Federal requirements**: Must comply with FLSA wage payment requirements

## Covered Final Wages
**Earned wages and salary**: All work performed through termination date
**Overtime compensation**: All earned overtime under FLSA
**Commissions**: Earned commissions based on employment agreement
**Bonuses**: Earned bonuses per company policy or agreement

## Vacation and PTO Payout
**No legal requirement**: Florida does not mandate vacation payout upon termination
**Company policy controls**: Payout required if company policy provides
**Written policies**: Establish clear vacation accrual and payout terms
**Use-it-or-lose-it**: Permitted if clearly communicated to employees

## Wage Payment Methods
**Acceptable methods**:
- Cash payment
- Company check
- Direct deposit (with employee consent)
- Payroll card (with proper employee protections)

**Employee preference**: May choose method if multiple options offered

## Deductions from Final Pay
**Authorized deductions only**:
- Taxes and required withholdings
- Court-ordered deductions (child support, garnishments)
- Employee-authorized deductions (with written consent)

**Prohibited deductions**:
- Cash shortages or inventory losses
- Equipment damage (without written authorization)
- Training costs or uniforms (unless authorized)

## Commission and Bonus Payments
**Earned commissions**: Must be paid according to written agreement
**Draw against commissions**: Employer may seek repayment of unearned draw
**Discretionary bonuses**: Payment subject to company policy
**Clawback provisions**: Must be clearly stated in written agreements

## Seasonal and Tourism Employment
**High turnover considerations**:
- Seasonal employee final pay processing
- Multiple terminations during peak seasons
- Coordination with temporary staffing agencies
- International worker final pay procedures

## Record-Keeping Requirements
**Maintain records**:
- Final pay calculations and payments
- Vacation accrual and payout records
- Commission calculations and payments
- Deduction authorizations and amounts

**Retention period**: 3 years minimum under FLSA

## Expense Reimbursements
**Required reimbursements in final pay**:
- Business expenses incurred by employee
- Required tools or equipment costs
- Travel expenses and mileage reimbursements

**Documentation**: Employer may require receipts and approval

## Multi-State Considerations
**EOR implications**:
- Florida employees follow Florida final pay rules
- Coordination with other state requirements for multi-state employees
- Consider employee relocations during employment

## Enforcement
**Florida Department of Economic Opportunity**: Limited enforcement role
**Federal enforcement**: FLSA violations enforced by DOL
**Private lawsuits**: Employees may sue for unpaid wages
**Remedies**: Unpaid wages, liquidated damages, attorney fees

## Best Practices
**Policy development**:
- Clear final paycheck timing policies
- Written vacation and PTO policies
- Commission and bonus calculation procedures
- Expense reimbursement guidelines

**Administrative procedures**:
- Standardized termination checklists
- Final pay calculation worksheets
- Documentation of final pay delivery
- Coordination between HR and payroll

## Common Issues
**Vacation policy confusion**: Unclear vacation payout requirements
**Commission disputes**: Disagreements over earned vs. unearned commissions
**Deduction authorization**: Lack of written consent for deductions
**Timing expectations**: Employee expectations for immediate payment

## Technology and Automation
**Payroll systems**: Configure for Florida final pay requirements
**Final pay processing**: Automated calculations and approvals
**Documentation**: Electronic record-keeping and audit trails
**Employee communication**: Automated final pay notifications

## Comparison to Other States
**More employer-friendly**:
- No immediate final pay requirement
- No automatic vacation payout requirement
- Flexible payment timing options

## Recent Developments
**Legislative monitoring**: Track potential changes to Florida wage law
**Federal updates**: Monitor FLSA wage payment requirements
**Case law**: Court interpretations of wage payment obligations

## Tourism Industry Considerations
**Seasonal workforce**: High-volume terminations during season changes
**Tip reporting**: Final pay coordination with reported tip income
**International employees**: Visa status and final pay considerations
**Temporary housing**: Coordination with employer-provided housing

## Employer Checklist

- Calculate final paychecks accurately including all earned wages and commissions
